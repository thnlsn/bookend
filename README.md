## About The Project

This is Bookend, an imaginary app that aims to streamline the booking process for your trip, whether it be buisiness or vacation. Let us bookend your trip by setting you on the right foot and closing it off with details for your return. Book your hotel, flights, car rentals, and maybe even some tours to enjoy while you're there! All of the above is available on Bookend.
